## 🧠 Philosophy

Asteroid is designed for clarity, modularity, and future-proofing.  
Each stage lives in its own file (`core/normalize.js`, `core/validate.js`, etc.), making it easy to extend, test, and evolve.

Built entirely in Termux on Android, Asteroid proves that powerful tools can be born anywhere.
