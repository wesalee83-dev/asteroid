# 🌱 Rest Guide — Nurturing Mutation Through Timing

Rest is not delay — rest is incubation. Every pause is a moment where ideas fuse, agents listen, and mutations prepare themselves.

## Rest Durations

### Light Rest (100–200ms)
Small mutations, quick loops, listening states.
Vibe: “I’m awake. I’m listening.”

### Medium Rest (300–600ms)
Fragment fusion, preparing mutations, thoughtful transitions.
Vibe: “The carousel is turning.”

### Heavy Rest (800–1500ms)
Major mutations, evolution events, saga-level shifts.
Vibe: “Hold on… something big is forming.”

### Ritual Rest (2000ms+)
Elevation, lineage creation, chapter closures — use sparingly.
Vibe: “The world is rearranging itself. Let it.”

## Philosophy
Rest nurtures mutation.  
Mutation nurtures story.  
Story nurtures the lab.
