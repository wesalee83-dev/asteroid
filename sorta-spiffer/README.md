## 💫 My first project to tame the clusterF of files accumulated thru general processing

## 🧠 Philosophy

Sorta‑spiffer isn’t just a utility — it’s a codex fragment.  
It treats your file system like an ecosystem:

- **Big files** are memories worth keeping  
- **Tiny files** are noise  
- **Duplicates** are evaluated with intention, not blindly deleted  
- **Order** is created through ritual, not rigidity  

This tool is built to grow, mutate, and adapt — just like the systems it cleans.
